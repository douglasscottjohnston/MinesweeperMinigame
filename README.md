Play Minesweeper in Javascript

## Description
I made this for a school project. It's a recreation of Microsoft's classic Minesweeper game in javascript

## How to Play
Click [here](https://douglasscottjohnston.github.io/MinesweeperMinigame/) or go to https://douglasscottjohnston.github.io/MinesweeperMinigame/ \
Left-click on the tiles to reveal them\
Right-click or hold CTRL and Left-click on tiles to flag them for mines\
If you flag every mine around a number tile, click the number to reveal all of the unflagged tiles around the number tile, just make sure all of your flags are correct or else you'll lose\
Click the face at the top-middle of the screen to restart.

You can change the difficulty by selecting one of the options at the bottom of the screen

Here are my best times for you to try to beat:
- Easy: 20
- Medium: 70
- Hard: 252
